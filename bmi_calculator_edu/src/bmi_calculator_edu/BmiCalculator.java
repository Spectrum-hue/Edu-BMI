/*
 * This program serves as a solution to a task created to serve as a bootcamp question for students at a Bootcamp institution.
 * Basic instruction for students:
 * - Create a program that calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the user.
 * - Ask the user to enter his/her height and weight.
 * - Any measurement system - Imperial (e.g. feet, inches and pounds) or Metric(e.g. meters and kilograms) can be used.
 * - Use your own initiative regarding the methods used to calculate the BMI.
 * - This program should however include at least 1 basic math method from the Java Math Class.
 * - Also create at least one method that determine whether the BMI of a person falls in a specific category.
 * - Call the method in the main method.
